Try to remember that we are volunteering our time to try to assist people such as yourself.
bindport|If you get a message like "failed to bind to port!", one of three things is happening: 1) Either you are starting a Minecraft server when you already have one running, 2) there is a firewall or other service using or blocking the port, 3) you have specified an IP address in server.properties that does not exist on your server.  The server-ip line of server.properties should in nearly all cases remain blank.

cantkeepup|That message is perfectly normal, and happens all the time. However, if the console is spamming it or it occurs very frequently, then it is indicating that the machine is not powerful enough to run the server.
causality|If, as soon as you changed something (like, say, adding a mod or texture pack), everything goes pear-shaped and no longer works, is is most likely that the recent change was the probable cause of the problems.;;Undo what you did that broke everything.

error/badlogin|Failed to login: Bad login;;This error message occurs when logging in to an smp server fails because the server was unable to verify the client's login info. Frequently caused by piracy, as the client will not have a valid login, but also caused if someone logs in with the same username from 2 clients at once. Be sure you purchased the game, and only run minecraft once at any time.
error/cantconnect|Cannot connect to minecraft.net;;This error can occur for a number of reasons, including outdated java config, incorrect system time, or firewall issues. To fix it, make sure the system time is correct, check that java is allowed to access the internet, and if that fails, uninstall and reinstall java.
error|It's not helpful to just say "Some error" or "Some message".  We need to know exactly what error(s) you are getting in order to tell you what it means.;;If the error is more than one or two lines, please use PasteBin (http://www.pastebin.com) so as not to flood the channel.
error/javacrash|A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment;;This error happens when something causes java to become unstable. The usual culprit is lwjgl (and therefore video drivers), however, it can be caused by a broken JVM.  Reinstall your video card drivers, and if that fails, run javara and then reinstall java.
error/pixelformat|Bad video card drivers! ... org.lwjgl.LWJGLException: Pixel format not accelerated;;This error message occurs when minecraft can't find graphics drivers with which it can render the game. Caused by improperly installed or missing video drivers. Installing or reinstalling your video drivers usually fixes this problem.
error/textspecificlcd|Stack Trace: http://pastebin.com/Uiyx3AuF This error occurs when certain windows settings are unconfigured or configured improperly.;;To fix this issue, you must configure your ClearType settings.  See this factoid for instructions:  ?? win/cleartype
error/timedout|Failed to connect to the server - Connection timed out;;This message occurs when minecraft attempts to connect to an SMP server, but receives no response. Can be caused by firewall issues, both client or server side, or by trying to connect to a nonexistent server. Make sure java is allowed through any firewalls you have, and double check the server address.

freebsd/securityexception|The JVM seems to have issues with FreeBSD symlinking /dev/urandom to /dev/random, which can lead to a traceback like this: https://pastebin.com/9e8THiSm;;This can be fixed by launching Minecraft with '-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/random'.
fubar/hamachi|Hamachi has been squatting on an IANA-allocated IP space (25.0.0.0/8). As such, Hamachi conflicts with the internet. Concordantly, #MineCraftHelp will neither support nor assist with server network issues for hosts using Hamachi for connectivity.;;If you are using Hamachi, use a different solution such as proper port forwarding, or a VPN.
fubar/nic|Unfortunately, Minecraft has an incompatibility with certain network interface chipsets that manifests with a "Recv Timed Out" or a "Socket Write" error.;;Your only three solutions at the moment are to buy a new NIC, to switch to Linux or MacOS (which does not have this problem), or to wait for Notch to find and fix the problem.
fubar/zonealarm|Don't use ZoneAlarm.  It's bloated, resource-heavy software that does more harm than good, and in fact is known to cause problems with Minecraft specifically, such as connecting to servers and falling endlessly through the void, or even crashing servers entirely.;;Official report thread about ZA-induce server crashes is here:  http://getsatisfaction.com/mojang/topics/minecraft_crashes_in_multiplayer_socketexception_if_firewa

gpu/amd|You can get drivers for AMD (formerly ATI) GPUs here:  http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx
gpu/discrete| Some laptops have 'discrete GPUs', which detect when games and the like are being run, and switch from the weaker GPU (usually Intel) to the strong (usually AMD or NVIDIA).  Unfortunately, the mode detection is not foolproof, and Minecraft is often not detected as a graphics-intensive program, even though it is.;; Some possible fixes for this are installing a more capable Intel GPU driver, or changing a BIOS setting to always use the better GPU.  Details on each of these options can be found at http://bit.ly/ORHfpX

mc.net/authdown|If you get a "Can't connect to minecraft.net" via the downloaded client, and the website is up, the authentication server is most likely overloaded. Please be patient, and in the meantime, try using the in-browser client available at minecraft.net until Mojang can address this issue.
mc.net/down|Presently, there are problems with some of the parts of minecraft.net, which may cause errors or other problems when attempting to log in or to play the game.;;Just sit tight and give it some time, and things will be back to normal soon.
mc.net/hosting|Since migrating over to Amazon's EC2 cloud, the cluster servers for minecraft.net have been under impressive strain. It has continually buckled under the pressure of registering users, authenticating clients, crediting accounts, providing custom skin content, maintaining a classic server directory, as well as providing a front-end website for users.;;This is clearly not intended and Mojang is working on a new server arrangement, but is ensuring that it's done properly and not just quickly as was the move to Amazon.
mc.net/paid|There is a very simple way to see whether Mojang believes your account is paid for or not.  Log in at https://account.mojang.com/me and look for a 'My Games' heading.  If you don't see Minecraft listed there, nor in My Gift Codes, then Mojang has not received your monies.

save/null|If your computer unexpectedly died, and your Minecraft world suddenly no longer works, try loading it (the world) in MCEdit, and resaving the world. This is known to sometimes fix the problem.;;MCEdit can be found at http://is.gd/rnBfkU-
save/recovery|A tool to possibly recover corrupted worlds can be found at http://www.mcsaver.net
scam|If you bought a gift code from anywhere but minecraft.net, it's quite likely a scam. Mojang does not give out discounts for purchasing gift codes so there's absolutely no profit to be made.;;DO NOT purchase minecraft from any site other than minecraft.net, under any circumstances, period.
scold/advertise|This channel is not a venue for unsolicited advertisements. Please do not do that again.  This is your warning.
scold/flood|Please do not paste large globs of text into the IRC channel. This is called 'flooding' and is considered _very_ rude.;;If you have an error log or other information to share that is more then one or two lines, use pastebin.com.  see pastebin for more information.
scold/listen|If you aren't going to listen to the advice from the volunteers here, don't ask for it in the first place.
scold/pebcak|Fixing problems requires some amount of self-help ability, to say nothing of literacy (both in terms of language and computers), and ability to exactly follow instructions.  If you are in over your head technically, hire a professional.  We're here to help with Minecraft, not teach basic computer use from scratch.;;That said, we honestly do wish to help.  It may be possible someone here might be able to assist you through TeamViewer, a screen-sharing utility.

scold/repeat|There is absolutely no need to repeat messages in IRC.  Messages do not 'expire' and unless there is a lot of conversation, your message is not going anywhere.;;Failure to follow this rule is very irritating, clouds the chat, and is almost certain you get you kicked for spamming.
scold/shout|There is no need to yell.  The acoustics in here are wonderful.
scold/spam|We can hear you just fine, and your text does not disappear automagically. Please do not spam the same thing over and over again.
scold/tweet|IRC has a very generous limit on the length of its messages.  Please, for the sake of our sanity, use complete words, such as 'you', 'one', and 'are', and not 'u', '1', and 'r'.

smp/savefiles|Yes, you can use your single-player world as a mutliplayer map (or vice versa). Just make the world= line in server.properties match the name of the directory the world you want to use is in.;;To use an SMP save in single-player, copy or rename the world directory to "world#" (where '#' is a number from one to five), and use that save slot in single-player.
